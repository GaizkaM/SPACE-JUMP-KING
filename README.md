# Space-Jump King

Welcome to **Space-Jump King**, an exciting video game developed in assembly language for the Motorola 68000 microprocessor using the EASy68k environment! This project was created as the final assignment for the **Computer Architecture II** course and combines peripheral management, graphics, and sounds to deliver a unique retro experience.

## ðŸ“– Description

**Space-Jump King** is a game where the main objective is to guide your character through platforms, jumping upwards while avoiding falling into the void. Each level increases the difficulty, introducing enemies and new mechanics to challenge your skills.
